# Projects

Welcome to my GitHub, below is a variety of personal, data-focused projects.

## Data engineering

* [Reverse geo-coding with Elasticsearch](https://github.com/Jamie3213/reverse_geocoding): in this project we use Elasticsearch and Python to encode spatial coordinates with census block level information.

## Machine learning

* [Classification](https://github.com/Jamie3213/heart-disease-classification): in this project we use multiple logistic regression and decision trees to predict whether a patient has heart disease.

* [Time series forecasting](https://github.com/Jamie3213/traffic-time-series): in this project we use ARIMA modelling to create a forecasting model for hourly traffic data.

* [Easy model deployment with AWS](https://github.com/Jamie3213/shiny-model-deployment): in this project we create a simple machine learning model and deploy it to a Shiny Server running in Amazon Web Services, using Amazon S3 to store our model.
