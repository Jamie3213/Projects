# Projects

Welcome to my GitHub, below is a variety of personal, data-focused projects.

* [Classification](https://github.com/Jamie3213/heart-disease-classification): in this project we use multiple logistic regression and decision trees to predict whether a patient has heart disease.

* [Time series forecasting](https://github.com/Jamie3213/traffic-time-series): in this project we use ARIMA modelling to create a forecasting model for hourly traffic data.

* [Tolstoy text analysis](https://github.com/Jamie3213/tolstoy-text-analysis): in this project we use the tidytext package to explore Leo Tolstoy's "The Kingdom of God is Within You".

* [Data wrangling and visualisation](https://github.com/Jamie3213/available-seat-miles): in this short project we use the ```nycflights13``` data set to calculate the available seat miles per airline and produce a waffle visualisation.

* [Deploying an ML model](https://github.com/Jamie3213/shiny-model-deployment): in this project we create a simple machine learning model and deploy it to a Shiny Server running in Amazon Web Services, using Amazon S3 to store our model.
